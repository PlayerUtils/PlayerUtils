PlayerUtils is a shared acc between me(E) and my friend(T)

We aim to create free software of various coding languages with versatile uses and we aim to bypass things such as 'AntiAutoclicker's; we believe that a player should not need to grind-
-24/7 just to do what they want!

Currently our projects are:
Advanced-Autoclicker

-----Project Requests-----

We allow people to give us project requests, here is an example format to do so:
Discord username: playerutils

Project Name: Advanced Autoclicker
Project Credits: T & E (This is used to credit you in the description)
Project Features: Input randomness, Input hold-time (If you have any custom features you want)

If this gets accepted, we will react with a checkmark, if it gets denied we will react with a cross mark
Remember, we have ZERO obligation to fullfil any request.
If your project has been accepted, we will message you when it's finished with a link to its page, if we are unable to complete it we will tell you
