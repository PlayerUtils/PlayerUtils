PlayerUtils is a shared acc between me(E) and my friend(T)

We aim to create free software of various coding languages with versatile uses and we aim to bypass things such as 'AntiAutoclicker's; we believe that a player should not need to grind-
-24/7 just to do what they want!

Currently our projects are:
Advanced-Autoclicker
